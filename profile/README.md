## Product Description

Think of this as a **Legit Aim Suite** for ULTRAKILL: display and mouse tuning for pixel-control, crosshair and FOV choices that make targets read faster, weapon-swap logic that turns every click into a highlight, and drills that hardwire flicks and coin shots. You still earn every frag—the game just stops fighting you.

What you’ll dial in:

* **Mouse Input Consistency:** Raw input, stable DPI, no acceleration.
* **Crosshair & FOV Clarity:** A reticle and field of view that expose weak points instantly.
* **Weapon Swap Tech:** Revolver coin shots, shotgun pop-ins, nail control, and rail quick-taps.
* **Micro- and Macro-Drills:** Bite-sized routines that build real, sticky aim—fast.

## Features 🚀

* **Raw Input & No Accel:** Turn on raw input; disable OS or driver acceleration. Lock DPI (e.g., 800–1600) and match your in-game sens so muscle memory doesn’t drift.
* **FOV That Serves You:** Wider FOV = awareness; too wide = tiny targets. Start mid-high, then adjust until flick distances feel natural and weak points are readable.
* **Clean Crosshair:** Solid, small crosshair with strong contrast; avoid fancy outlines that hide head-sized targets at speed.
* **Visual Noise Control:** Motion blur, film grain, heavy vignette—off. You want razor edges while sliding, dashing, and swapping.
* **Weapon-Cycling Presets:** One-tap binds for Revolver ⇄ Shotgun ⇄ Railcannon. Swap behavior on a short cooldown keeps your rhythm lethal.
* **Revolver Coin Mastery:** Flip and tag the coin—bullets ricochet to the nearest enemy for crisp weak-point hits. This is your “aimbot feel” without the drama.
* **Shotgun Burst Logic:** Quick pop-ins for stagger windows, then swap back to precision pieces so you never lose sightline control.
* **Rail Quick-Taps:** Single, confident clicks on exposed weak points; no tunnel vision, no over-aim.
* **Nailgun Utility:** Use sustained fire to herd or chip while lining up a revolver finisher; don’t let it drag your crosshair off-task.
* **Parry Timing Habits:** Feedbacker/Knuckleblaster parries stabilize fights and open safe aim windows—accuracy rises when you’re not panicking.

* *In-Game Drills:* Teach timing on **coin flips**, **dash-peek flicks**, and **rail taps**—the stuff that matters in ULTRAKILL’s pace.

## Installation Instructions — Build Your Legit Aim Suite 🛠️

1. **Mouse & Sens Setup**

   * Enable **raw input**; turn **mouse acceleration** off (OS/driver and in-game).
   * Pick a DPI and keep it. Tune in-game sens until a **180° turn** takes the same desk distance every time.
   * Set a **uniform ADS/zoom multiplier** if applicable so scoped shots don’t feel alien.

2. **FOV & Visual Clarity**

   * Start mid-high FOV; raise until peripheral tracking is comfy, then stop before targets look ant-sized.
   * Disable **motion blur**, **film grain**, and **heavy chromatic aberration**.
   * Add **light sharpening** if available—just enough for edge definition, no halos.

3. **Crosshair & Colors**

   * Choose a **solid, high-contrast reticle** that stays visible against bright effects.
   * Avoid animated or thick reticles that mask weak points.

4. **Bind Logic (the sauce)**

   * Map **primary swap keys** for Revolver ⇄ Shotgun ⇄ Railcannon.
   * Put **coin flip** and **alt-fires** on reachable keys you can hit during a dash or slide.
   * Add a **panic parry** bind (Feedbacker/Knuckleblaster) you can press mid-flick.

5. **Audio & Focus**

   * Keep SFX clear so you hear telegraphs; loud, muddy mixes make you over-aim and miss timing windows.
   * If needed, lower ambience slightly during boss arenas to emphasize cues.

6. **Warmup Block (5–10 minutes)**

   * **Line Trace:** Move crosshair along wall edges and signs smoothly—no jitter.
   * **Dot Microflicks:** Pick tiny map decals; flick-return-flick-return.
   * **Strafe Tracking:** Circle-strafe a distant object, keeping the crosshair glued.

7. **Combat Drills (the “aimbot” feel)**

   * **Coin Flicks:** Flip a coin, track it with your eyes, and tap the shot *through* it. Start close, increase distance and speed.
   * **Dash-Peek Rail:** Dash out, single rail tap, dash back—no scope drag, no double micro-corrections.
   * **Shotgun Pop → Revolver Finish:** Pop-in with shotgun for stagger, instant swap, revolver tap to weak point.
   * **Parry → Punish:** Practice parrying a projectile, then immediately coin flick or rail tap while the target is frozen by your rhythm.
   * **Movement Sandwich:** Slide → jump → flick coin → revolver tap. This locks the timing of camera motion + shot release.

8. **Review & Adjust**

   * If you’re **overshooting**, lower sens a hair or add a touch of smoothing (if available).
   * If you’re **hesitating**, your FOV might be too wide or your crosshair too busy. Tighten both.
   * Save two profiles: **Speed Maps** (slightly wider FOV) and **Precision Maps** (slightly tighter FOV, leaner effects).

## Advanced Tips & Tech 🧠

* **Coin Control:** Toss the coin so it sits in your natural flick path. With practice, you won’t “aim at the enemy”—you’ll aim at the coin and let the ricochet handle the rest.
* **Weapon Rhythm:** Revolver tap → tiny reposition → rail tap. The micro-stutter keeps aim fresh and prevents over-commit.
* **Angle Discipline:** Treat arenas like slices; clear one lane at a time so your flicks are preloaded where a head should appear.
* **Camera Composure:** Two micro-corrections max per target. If you need more, reset position instead of muscling the crosshair.
* **Stutter-Stepping:** Tiny strafe taps can help settle your hand before a precise click—just don’t break line-of-sight.
